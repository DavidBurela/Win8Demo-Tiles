Windows 8 demo - Tile updates
=============

A sample application I use at user group and conference talks.
The source code demonstrates how to update the tiles of your own applications. The samples have been kept as simple as possible to allow you to copy / paste the code.

Samples
--------

Included in the source code are samples on how to:

* Update the application tile with text.
* Update the application tile with a image stored in the application
* Update the application tile with a image on a remote web server
* How to use the XML templates and modify them for your own use
